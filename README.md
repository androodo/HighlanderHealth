# Highlander Health

Highlander Health is a full-stack web application designed to empower UCR students on their health and fitness journey. This project provides users with personalized daily meal plans based on their unique metrics and the current UCR dining hall menu. By leveraging modern web technologies and advanced data analysis, I created an efficient tool to offer tailored nutrition guidance.

## Overview

Highlander Health allows users to input personal data such as weight, height, and dietary goals. Using this information, the application generates a custom daily meal plan based on the up-to-date UCR dining hall menu. The project combines a user-friendly interface with a powerful backend to ensure accurate and personalized nutrition recommendations.

The backend integrates the GPT-3.5 Turbo API for sophisticated analysis of user data and meal plan creation. Additionally, libraries such as Beautiful Soup and Pandas are utilized to scrape and process data from the UCR dining hall menu, ensuring the recommendations remain current and relevant for over 100 UCR students daily.
